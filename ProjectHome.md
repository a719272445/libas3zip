libas3zip is an ActionScript 3.0 library for working with [ZIP files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)).

libas3zip is founded by David Chang. It was originally licensed under the [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), but is - in my understanding - now licensed under the [LGPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).

An other ActionScript 3.0 ZIP library is [FZip](http://codeazur.com.br/lab/fzip/). FZip does the same as libas3zip but requires Adler32 checksums to work.
